🖐️ Invisible Hand – Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe
Invisible Hand is a real-time hand tracking project built with OpenCV and MediaPipe. It allows your webcam to detect and track hand landmarks, enabling gesture-based interaction or visualization—even when the hand is not fully visible. This can be extended for gesture recognition, virtual control interfaces, AR, and more.
